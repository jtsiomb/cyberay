cyberay
=======
Cyberay is an experimental renderer, and eventually game, aiming to explore the
viability of realtime raytracing on high thread count multi-core CPUs. The plan
is to utilize the GPU only for UI drawing and post-processing, possibly
denoising, while leaving all the game rendering to the CPU(s).

The project name is derived from the planned cyberpunk aesthetic of the eventual
game, chosen to maximise interesting light sources and shiny environments which
should suit the renderer well.

This project is in a very early stage.
